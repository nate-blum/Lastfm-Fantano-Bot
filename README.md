Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my side projects. \
This is a Discord bot that I created in high school with two functions:

### Last.fm:

Last.fm is a site that my friends and I use to keep track of our listening habits,
as it stores every single song we listen to, known as a "scrobble". Over time I added
a wide variety of functionality to it, including commands to view one's top artists,
albums, and tracks, all over variable time, and commands to compare your number of scrobbles
with another person's. I added additional functionality that stored every instance of a
function call in a MongoDB database so that on the next call, it could tell you what the change
was (for instance, you listened to a particular artist 30 times since the last time you checked).

### Fantano Bot:

Anthony Fantano is the most popular music critic on YouTube. He reviews nearly every major
and minor release of the year, so I created a command to check all previous reviews for a
particular artist and which score he gave each project. Mostly, I used it to know which
albums to listen to first when trying out a new artist's music for the first time.
